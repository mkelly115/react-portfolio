The purpose of this application is to showcase our ability to make a functional web page using React. This webpage will include an about me section, a resume link with candidate qualifications, a contact section with validation and the ability to send a message to the candidate, and a portfolio section that will include 6 projects with photos, background information, and links to the associated gitHub repos. This project will showcase the use of components, various packages, and the ability for a web page to swap on the fly without loading. It will also be a test of CSS/Bootstrap skills in the process of creating not only a functional page, but one that is easy to navigate and read through.

## Usage

On the development end, a user will run npm i followed by npm run dev to access the webpage and up to the second changes in styling or html. The development user will be able to access the page for any updates that are needed as they are saved to the file. For the average user, they will access this web page via a web browser from a live link and only see the single div and components that are swapped in and out as they navigate through the webpage.

## Conclusion

This project was one of the best in my opinion. It felt like the past months of class time for front end culminating in a single project. Each layer of class from the first weeks of basic HTML and CSS, to the later weeks of Javascript, even to the more recent months of backend work has come together to allow me to begin to showcase just what we have accomplished over the past six months. It became as simple as understanding how React itself worked and not needing to constantly reference past projects to get the HTML and CSS for each component in order. 

I would say that for this project, I found that I enjoyed the work involed with making each component work, the research involved to understand exactly how to keep my header and footer persistent without affect the individual swapped components. It felt like a solid amount of research was needed, but rather than being stressed, it felt like a challenge and another aspect of coding to learn and add to the repitoire.

As with any project there are struggles, and getting my individual portfolio components to render correctly was my biggest struggle. I got it working within a day, but I will admit that while I know how to use .map, I dont quite understand exactly why it works and it is one of the topics I plan to expand on in my free time. I understand how to use the function, but I don't grasp the why of it and that is something I plan on fixing before the end of this program.

Overall, I would say this has been one of the most enjoyable assignments we have had and I really enjoyed how it gave a bigger glance at just how far we have come from october.
