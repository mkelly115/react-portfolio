                Welcome to my portfolio for full stack web development! I am just completeing my class in HTML, CSS,

                I am originally from Cranford, New Jersey where I was born and raised. I lived there until the age of 18 when I traveled to Biddeford, Maine
                to go to college at the University of New England where I majored in Political Science and played rugby for four years. I still reside in the New England
                area after falling in love with it.

                It was after college that I proceeded to work a large array of fields finding exactly what would bring me the most happiness. My background
                includes time as a store manager of a million dollar store, work as a senate aid, and a career in firefighting. After a bout of illness during my 
                firefighting career, I have deemed it important to find a career that works for me. I have always been what people would describe as a "nerd", but
                it had never come to mind that I could make a career of that. I jumped head first into coursework to learn full stack web development and as time went 
                on I learned more not only about the field, but about my love for problem solving and the logic of how coding works.
