                Full Stack Web Developer | Problem-Solver | Team Player
              </h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Welcome! Iâ€™m a passionate and results-driven full-stack web
                developer with a certificate in web development from the
                University of New Hampshire.
              </p>
              <p>
                My background blends modern web technologies like JavaScript,
                React, and Node with strong leadership and problem-solving
                skills built through years in management and emergency services.
              </p>
              <p>
                I specialize in designing, building, and deploying dynamic
                applications that balance functionality, performance, and user
                experience. Whether collaborating in a fast-paced team
                environment or tackling challenges independently, I thrive on
                delivering solutions that exceed expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am currently seeking opportunities in full-stack or front-end
                development, where I can apply my skills to build scalable
                applications, contribute to innovative projects, and grow as
                part of a collaborative team.
